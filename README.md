# Udacity.TMDB.Movie
I have chosen the movies dataset to work with for this project. We will first get to know the different properties this dataset has, then bridge any gaps it possess by wrangling the dataset. After cleaning the dataset we will explore its characteristics and try to use visualizations to answer the questions this dataset raises. The main questions we will try to investigate in this dataset is :

What production company had the most success based on these 10,000 movies?
How did movie genres change over time?
